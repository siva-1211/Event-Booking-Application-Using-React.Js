# Event-Booking-Application-Using-React.Js

Here, I created an event booking application using React. Js also includes various components like Antd, React icons, and React Bootstrap, and implements various logic with React hooks like usestate, useeffect, and usenavigate.
In these applications, there are two options: one is an online event and the other is an offline event, so we can book either type of event and also have user login credentials.
